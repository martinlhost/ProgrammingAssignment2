# This file contains two main functions that solve Programming Assignment 2 in the Coursera R course from the John Hopkins University
# The assigmemnt is solved by Martin HÃ¶st / martin.l.host@gmail.com


# This function generates a new matrix that can be used as input to the casheSolve function
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## This function gives the inverse of a matrix that is produced by the makeCacheMatrix function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        
}
